This is an example firmware I found that publishes a message to the Particle cloud after a certain amount of miles (specified in dist-tracker.ino) is reached. This can be studied to figure out how to track distance travelled by rapidly requesting vehicle speed from the car as it's moving.

Copied here in case the Carloop guys decide to take it down.
