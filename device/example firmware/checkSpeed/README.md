## checkSpeed

This is a program you can flash to the Electron/Carloop, then plug the device into your car's OBD-II port, then use Particle cloud console on your phone to request the speed (km/h) from your car while driving.

It's a good idea to have someone else operate the phone while you drive, since hitting the button is harder than texting. 

It requires the `carloop` library. 

The program can be edited to allow your phone (through the Particle cloud console) to request any OBD-II information from your car (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OBD-II_PIDs#Standard_PIDs) while the car is on. Reach out to Spencer for more info.
