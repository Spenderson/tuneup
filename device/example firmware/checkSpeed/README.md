## checkSpeed

This is a program you can upload to the Electron/Carloop, then plug the device into your car's OBD-II port, then use Particle cloud console on your phone to check request the speed (km/h) from your car while driving. 

It's a good idea to have someone else operate the phone while you drive, since hitting the button is harder than texting. 

It requires the `carloop` library. 

The program can be editted to request any OBD-II information from your car from your phone while it's on. Reach out to Spencer if you'd like help.
