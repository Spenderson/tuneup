Starting the project off by just creating a simple web app. Nothing fancy, just want to get something built.

### program logic.md

A document to list out the logic that the application will use: a rough idea of how it works and the proposed output. Since I only know SAS and bits and pieces of other languages, the "code" chunks are written only to portray the logic, not to be computer readable. 

### log.json

This is my car's maintenance log. The program will read this in, edit it, and save to the same location. The application will also display information from this file to the user. 

### output_test.json

Test output JSON file, to be output in a table on the webpage after the mileage is submitted. Use to test webpage function before having to make sure the server programming is buttoned up.
